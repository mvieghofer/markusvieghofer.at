Well, that’s me.

Hi, my name is Markus Vieghofer.


## Who am I?

In my normal life I’m a full-time software developer, dad, sports man, … Here I serve you as a blogger writing mostly about the stuff I come across while coding.

Besides coding at work or as a hobby at home I do sports (weightlifting in the gym or running outside in the woods) or spending time with my family (girlfriend, son and our Entlebucher Mountain Dog [Diego](https://devcouch-mvieghofer.rhcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DSC_6756_mini.jpg "our Entlebucher Mountain Dog "Diego"")).

I’m blogging some time now, since 2011 to be exact. I learned a lot since then, also about blogging. With my new blog DevCouch I want to create a high quality blog about software development and all related topics.

I don’t have time to be always here writing and publishing new posts. When I’m not here writing for you, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mvieghofer "This is me on twitter."),  [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MarkusVieghofer/posts "My Google+ profile.") or you contact me using the [Contact](http://devcouch.net/contact/ "Contact") page.


## What to expect on this blog?

As mentioned earlier, most of the times I’ll write about coding. I’ll giving you tutorials on certain technologies and frameworks or sharing my thoughts about tech things.

I’ll try to cover the architectural aspect first and go deeper into certain technologies in follow-up posts. For example there might be an article about logging following by articles about certain logging frameworks.
