Hi!

This is my first post on this blog here. After I realised, that my blog ([thatsthaway.wordpress.com](http://thatsthaway.wordpress.com "thatsthaway.wordpress.com")) became a little chaotic I decided to start a new one. It should be more organised and I also wanted to get rid of some older posts :P.

I hope youâ€™ll enjoy reading my posts!
