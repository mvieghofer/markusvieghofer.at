Since I’ve upgraded my Galaxy S3 to Cyanogenmod 10.2 it runs with Android 4.3.1. Everything was totally fine until I decided to do some Android development again. There was no way to activate USB debugging anymore.

In order to get the Developer options again you have to follow these three steps:

1. Go to settings -> About phone
2. Look for the “Build number”
3. Tap seven times on the Build number (after your third tap you will see how many time you need to tap to get the Developer options)

Congratulations, you are a developer now and can access the Developer options. You can now go to the Developer options and check the USB Debugging option.
