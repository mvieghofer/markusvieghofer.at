One thing I always forget is how to enable word wrap in [Notepad++.](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad++ Homepage") Some time ago I needed that option and as usual I forgot how to enable it. After some google research I found how to do it (it is actually pretty simple). Here is how you do it.

1. Select the “View” option in the menu bar.
2. Look for the “Word wrap” option and enable it (you will see a check mark if it is enabled)

There you go, word wrap is enabled and you can read long lines without scrolling.
