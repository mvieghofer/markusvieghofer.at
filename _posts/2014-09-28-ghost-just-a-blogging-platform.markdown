A few months ago I found [an article](http://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/) written by Jeff Atwood about a new blogging software. Since I’m always curious about new software I followed his link to the [Ghost blog platform](http://ghost.org/).

After reading a little about it I really wanted to try it out. Since there was no hosting available at this time, I needed a place to deploy my newly downloaded piece of software. After some research I found an [openshift ghost quickstart](https://www.openshift.com/quickstarts/ghost-on-openshift) and because openshift offers a free PaaS solutions I gave it a try. It took me only a few minutes until I finally could start testing ghost.

The first thing I thought of when looking a ghost was one of Jeff Atwood’s sentences he wrote in his article:

> I’ve been a blog minimalist from the start, and finding a truly open source platform which reflects that minimalism and focus is incredibly refreshing.

I thought of this quote because ghost is a truly minimalistic blogging platform. A beautiful and minimalistic blogging platform.

The coolest feature of it is the split mode of the editor. You write one one side and get a preview on the other side. That’s how it should work (at least on a large screen).

Even though ghost is just at version 0.4.2 (at the time of this writing) it is a great tool. There there are still some things to improve but I would strongly encourage you to take at it. Since some time there is also the possibility to try it out for free (or you take a look at my playground installation [here](http://ghostblog-mvieghofer.rhcloud.com/)).
