Hashtags are cool. They are fun. Using a hashtag might help you find people with similar interest like you.

You find them on Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Facebook and other social media sites. Hashtags are everywhere.

But…


## Where does the hashtag come from?

The first time hashtags were used to tag a message was on Twitter. However, they weren’t actually invented by Twitter.

The idea of creating tags for a message by placing a pound symbol before a word came actually from a Twitter user.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/barcamp?src=hash">#barcamp</a> [msg]?</p>&mdash; ❄︎ Chris Messina ❄︎ (@chrismessina) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412">August 23, 2007</a></blockquote>

Also other, now well-known, features of Twitter weren’t always there. Things like [retweeting](https://blog.twitter.com/2009/retweet-limited-rollout "Retweets") or [replying](https://blog.twitter.com/2007/are-you-twittering-me "Reply to users") were also suggested by [Twitter users](http://qz.com/135149/the-first-ever-hashtag-reply-and-retweet-as-twitter-users-invented-them/#/ "Twitter features not invented by Twitter"). Gladly Twitter recognized these suggestions as improvements to their application and implemented them as features.

Since nearly all big social media site, such as Facebook, Google+ or Instagram, also provides the possibility to use hashtags, they really became a big thing. Event most of the TV shows provide their own hashtag so that viewers can comment on the show.


## Why are hashtags important?

There [are](http://mashable.com/2013/10/08/what-is-hashtag/ "What is hashtag") [some](http://www.jeffbullas.com/2014/10/23/confused-by-hashtags-5-expert-tips-for-marketing-with-hashtags/#OzXBXFOEwfBzpk0B.99 "5 Tips for marketing with hashtags") [reasons](https://tv.yahoo.com/news/whats-hash-why-hashtags-tv-shows-matter-163648814.html "Why Hashtags for TV shows matter") why you should use hashtags. For me the most important reason is to broadcast your messages to a much larger audience. By using the right hashtags for your messages you can spread it to a lot more people than without using hashtags.

Also they can provide a way of receiving feedback from your customers. When TV shows create a hashtag for their show, they do it to get instant feedback from its viewers.

Even though there are a lot of reasons to use hashtags, you should never overuse them.
