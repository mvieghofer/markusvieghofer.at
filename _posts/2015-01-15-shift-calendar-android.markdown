[Some time ago](http://devcouch.net/shift-calendar/ "Shift Calendar"), I’ve created a web app that helps me adding the shifts of my girlfriend (who works as a nurse) to my google calendar.

The web app helped me a lot. Even though I only had to add her shifts once a month the process of doing it became a lot more comfortable.

However, I still had to add the shift events on my own. I decided to create an android app which my girlfriend might wanted to use, too. Now, this app is finished and published.

If you want to check it out, you can download the app from the google play store. I would appreciate any feedback either here on the blog or directly on the play store. Of course I would be glad for a 5 star rating.
