Some time ago two of my nephews visited me to learn programming. Since Java is [the most popular programming language](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and you can use it for a great varity of tasks &mdash; the fact that its my favorite language didn't matter at all ;) &mdash; I chose to teach them Java.

To be prepared and to have some kind of common theme I can rely on I started to write down what I thought is the most important basic information you need to know about Java. 

Now I've summarized all the things I think are the most important things of the basics of Java into a [Github repo](https://github.com/mvieghofer/java-beginner-tutorial). If you want to learn Java you are very welcome to check out this repository, read through it and do all the small programming challanges with the tutorial. If you want to contribute to something that helps others learn Java please check it out, too, and help me to improve it!
