<p>Since I’ve upgraded my Galaxy S3 to Cyanogenmod 10.2 it runs with Android 4.3.1. Everything was totally fine until I decided to do some Android development again. There was no way to activate USB debugging anymore.</p>

<p>In order to get the Developer options again you have to follow these three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to settings -&gt; About phone</li>
  <li>Look for the “Build number”</li>
  <li>Tap seven times on the Build number (after your third tap you will see how many time you need to tap to get the Developer options)</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations, you are a developer now and can access the Developer options. You can now go to the Developer options and check the USB Debugging option.</p>
