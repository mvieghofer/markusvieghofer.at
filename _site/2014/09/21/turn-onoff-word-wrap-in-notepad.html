<p>One thing I always forget is how to enable word wrap in <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" title="Notepad++ Homepage">Notepad++.</a> Some time ago I needed that option and as usual I forgot how to enable it. After some google research I found how to do it (it is actually pretty simple). Here is how you do it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the “View” option in the menu bar.</li>
  <li>Look for the “Word wrap” option and enable it (you will see a check mark if it is enabled)</li>
</ol>

<p>There you go, word wrap is enabled and you can read long lines without scrolling.</p>
