<p>A few months ago I found <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/">an article</a> written by Jeff Atwood about a new blogging software. Since I’m always curious about new software I followed his link to the <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost blog platform</a>.</p>

<p>After reading a little about it I really wanted to try it out. Since there was no hosting available at this time, I needed a place to deploy my newly downloaded piece of software. After some research I found an <a href="https://www.openshift.com/quickstarts/ghost-on-openshift">openshift ghost quickstart</a> and because openshift offers a free PaaS solutions I gave it a try. It took me only a few minutes until I finally could start testing ghost.</p>

<p>The first thing I thought of when looking a ghost was one of Jeff Atwood’s sentences he wrote in his article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been a blog minimalist from the start, and finding a truly open source platform which reflects that minimalism and focus is incredibly refreshing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought of this quote because ghost is a truly minimalistic blogging platform. A beautiful and minimalistic blogging platform.</p>

<p>The coolest feature of it is the split mode of the editor. You write one one side and get a preview on the other side. That’s how it should work (at least on a large screen).</p>

<p>Even though ghost is just at version 0.4.2 (at the time of this writing) it is a great tool. There there are still some things to improve but I would strongly encourage you to take at it. Since some time there is also the possibility to try it out for free (or you take a look at my playground installation <a href="http://ghostblog-mvieghofer.rhcloud.com/">here</a>).</p>
