<p>My girlfriend works as a nurse. In her job all nurses may choose theirs shifts on their own. In order to share her shifts with me we use a shared google calendar.</p>

<p>Adding her shifts to my google calendar was always a hassle. There are some features missing to map the process of adding the same type of event for multiple individual dates.</p>

<p>Of course if there is a certain regularity in the events, such as every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, you could create one event and repeat it. However, her shifts doesn’t have a regularity which makes adding shift events very hard.</p>

<p>The main feature I was missing was that you can’t define event templates that can, at least, be reused for creating multiple events. The workflow I had to use was creating on event of a certain shift type, duplicate it and change the date to the date I want the event to add.</p>

<p>After living with this hassle for some time, I’ve decided to create a little webapp that helps me adding the shifts to my calendar.</p>

<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/dknh3c1bk/image/upload/v1452021930/demo_Screenshot_innr0l.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/dknh3c1bk/image/upload/h_162,w_300/v1452021930/demo_Screenshot_innr0l.png?resize=300%2C162" alt="Shift Calendar Web" /></a></p>

<p>The main setup of the app is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create types of shifts you want to add to your calendar</li>
  <li>Login to your google account</li>
</ol>

<p>Then you can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the type of shift you want to add</li>
  <li>Select the calendar the shifts should be added to</li>
  <li>Select the dates the shift should be added on</li>
</ol>

<p>Then you apply the dates and all the predefined events are added to the selected calendar. The web app is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/mvieghofer/shiftcalendar-web" title="github">github</a>.
