<p>Hashtags are cool. They are fun. Using a hashtag might help you find people with similar interest like you.</p>

<p>You find them on Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Facebook and other social media sites. Hashtags are everywhere.</p>

<p>But…</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-hashtag-come-from">Where does the hashtag come from?</h2>

<p>The first time hashtags were used to tag a message was on Twitter. However, they weren’t actually invented by Twitter.</p>

<p>The idea of creating tags for a message by placing a pound symbol before a word came actually from a Twitter user.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/barcamp?src=hash">#barcamp</a> [msg]?</p>&mdash; ❄︎ Chris Messina ❄︎ (@chrismessina) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412">August 23, 2007</a></blockquote>

<p>Also other, now well-known, features of Twitter weren’t always there. Things like <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2009/retweet-limited-rollout" title="Retweets">retweeting</a> or <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2007/are-you-twittering-me" title="Reply to users">replying</a> were also suggested by <a href="http://qz.com/135149/the-first-ever-hashtag-reply-and-retweet-as-twitter-users-invented-them/#/" title="Twitter features not invented by Twitter">Twitter users</a>. Gladly Twitter recognized these suggestions as improvements to their application and implemented them as features.</p>

<p>Since nearly all big social media site, such as Facebook, Google+ or Instagram, also provides the possibility to use hashtags, they really became a big thing. Event most of the TV shows provide their own hashtag so that viewers can comment on the show.</p>

<p>There <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/10/08/what-is-hashtag/" title="What is hashtag">are</a> <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2014/10/23/confused-by-hashtags-5-expert-tips-for-marketing-with-hashtags/#OzXBXFOEwfBzpk0B.99" title="5 Tips for marketing with hashtags">some</a> <a href="https://tv.yahoo.com/news/whats-hash-why-hashtags-tv-shows-matter-163648814.html" title="Why Hashtags for TV shows matter">reasons</a> why you should use hashtags. For me the most important reason is to broadcast your messages to a much larger audience. By using the right hashtags for your messages you can spread it to a lot more people than without using hashtags.</p>

<p>Also they can provide a way of receiving feedback from your customers. When TV shows create a hashtag for their show, they do it to get instant feedback from its viewers.</p>

<p>Even though there are a lot of reasons to use hashtags, you should never overuse them.</p>
