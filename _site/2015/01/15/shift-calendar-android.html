<p><a href="http://devcouch.net/shift-calendar/" title="Shift Calendar">Some time ago</a>, I’ve created a web app that helps me adding the shifts of my girl friend (who works as a nurse) to my google calendar.</p>

<p>The web app helped me a lot. Even though I only had to add her shifts once a month the process of doing it became a lot more comfortable.</p>

<p>However, I still had to add the shift events on my own. I decided to create an android app which my girl friend might wanted to use, too. Now, this app is finished and published.</p>

<p>If you want to check it out, you can download the app from the google play store. I would appreciate any feedback either here on the blog or directly on the play store. Of course I would be glad for a 5 star rating.</p>
