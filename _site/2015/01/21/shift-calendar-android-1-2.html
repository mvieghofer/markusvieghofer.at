<p>As you may now I recently published an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.devcouch.shiftcalendar" title="ShiftCalendar Android app">Android app</a> that helps you add shifts to your google calendar. Now I just published the newest version of the app. Even though there are just minor changes I wanted to notify you about it.</p>

<p><strong>Logout</strong> – The first new feature that was added to the app is that you have the option to logout. This was something I just forgot previously :P. Now you can switch between accounts easily.</p>

<p>All defined shift types are currently available for all accounts. This means they aren’t tied to the account but to the app. I haven’t decided yet if I will change this. In case you want to help me decide, leave a comment.</p>

<p><strong>Switch time and date formats</strong> – You can choose between some predefined time and date formats. Currently there are only predefined formats you can choose from.</p>

<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong> – Of course, I also fixed some bugs. Currently all known issues are resolved. In order you find some, please let me know :).</p>
