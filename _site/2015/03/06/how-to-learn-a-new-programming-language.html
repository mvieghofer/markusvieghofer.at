  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As I wrote in my last post I started to learn Python in the beginning of the year and I have to say learning a new programming language is rather complex.</p>

<p>As all languages (programming language or natural languages) you need to put a lot of effort in it and it can seem a bit overwhelming in the beginning.</p>

<p>To make learning a new programming language as easy a possible I’ve developed a small framework for myself I want to share with you. The following section describes what I do to learn a new programming language.</p>

<h1 id="grab-a-book">Grab a book</h1>

<p>Reading books about the programming language you want to learn is a great way to get a big picture of what you can do. It helps you understand the basic concepts and leads you while coding the first programs.</p>

<p>As always reading is a great way of getting (mostly theoretic) knowledge about a certain topic. I would strongly recommend you picking the standard book for the language you want to learn and use it as a guide.</p>

<p>However, books can’t teach you programming in a certain language. Only programming in a certain language will teach you how to code in this language.</p>

<p>I think books can give an overview and teach you about basic concepts but I would move quickly to the next point and start programming.</p>

<h1 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h1>

<p>After you read about the basic concepts and understood them well, it is time to go to the next step.</p>

<p>Actual programming.</p>

<p>When I do this, I search for someone who gives me small challenges that I need to solve. This could be some homework you need to do for school or university, a friend or colleague or some online platform.</p>

<p>For learning Python I chose the last option and search online. There are some online platforms that provide such services, e.g. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" title="Code Academy">codeacademy.com</a>, <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/" title="TopCoder">topcoder.com</a>, or <a href="http://coderbyte.com/" title="CoderByte">coderbyte.com</a>. I used coderbyte.com for my first Python challenges (which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/DevCouch/coderbyte_python" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>).</p>

<h1 id="create-your-own-project">Create your Own project</h1>

<p>When you know all the concepts and have a little experience with the language it is time to start a project.</p>

<p>This can be anything you want.</p>

<p>However start small and get bigger with the time. It is easy to get overwhelmed in the beginning and this can easily lead to loosing all the confidence you built up.</p>

<h2 id="one-last-special-tip">One last special tip:</h2>

<p>It would be a really good idea to let others (more experienced people) comment you code. Either you know somebody who can do that or you use <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/" title="Code Review on StackExchange">codereview.stackexchange.com</a> or any other online platform.</p>
