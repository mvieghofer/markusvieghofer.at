Hi stranger!

Apparently you wonder who I am and of course I will tell you a little bit about me.

I'm an experienced Java developer and work for <a href="http://www.karriere.at" target="_blank">karriere.at</a>.
I live in Austria, am married and a father of two.

On my blog I will publish all the challenges I come across while writing
software, often this will be something Java related. However I will also write
about things I struggled or find specifically interesting while coding Android
apps and all sorts of other [new] things I work on or think about.

Although I write all posts in all conscience, I cannot guarantee that anything I
write is correct :wink:.

I hope you enjoy my posts!
